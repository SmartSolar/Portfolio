    <p>I think kittens are adorable!<br>
      Sadly I dont have a kitten of my own but<br> 
      in the near future I would defnetly get one! </p>

      <p>Bubble Tea! My favorite is Tairo.<br> I usually drink them when Im feeling stressed or tired.</p>

     <p>Without this program I wouldnt have been able <br>
       to meet girls who had the same interests as me. <br>
       Most of the girls in my school want to <br>
       be doctors or some kind of business person.</p>

       <p>I dont like oranges due to its acidic feeling in my mouth. <br>
          I dont eat them often or at not all even. <br>
          To be honest I barely eat any fruits besides apples. <br>
          But that does not mean I like apple juice! <br> </p>

<img id="Ads" src="http://adsoftheworld.com/apple-touch-icon.png" width="140px" height="140px"> 
      <p>Too many ads! <br>
         Ads are okay until <br>
        they slow down your internet speed.<br>
         Like I dont dont check my yahoo email <br>
         Due to the amount of ads that pop up. <br>
         It evens makes me feel unsafe. <br></p>

      <p> Loud Places with a lot of people. <br>
         I barely go to places with a lot of people due <br> 
         to the sound and and fear of doing something wrong. <br> </p>

      <p>To Udacity`s online classes, I have felt more confident. <br>
      I learned most of my html from them. <br>
      They also kind of keep you from not coming back to class.<br>
       You have to submit projects and they keep you motivated. <br></p>

      <p> Codeacadamy was the very first thing that taught me to code. <br>
        Most of teachers in middle school introduced it to me. <br>
        Its considered a starting piont for<br>
        kids who want to purse the STEM field. <br> </p>

       <p> Youtube is one of the few ways I connect with the world. <br>
         I also watch LastWeekTonight and TheDailyShow <br>
         to relax but also be informed about the world. <br> </p>
